# Task Planner

An Android/iOS app developed by me and [Delano Lourenco](https://github.com/3ddelano). This app helps users create a daily schedule of tasks. We used the Gemini API to allow users to enter a brief description of their day and let Gemini create tasks for them.

This app was created using Flutter. We developed it from scratch, starting with zero knowledge of Flutter, balancing our busy college and work schedules. Within a few weeks, we learned how to develop apps using Flutter.

## How to Use This App

1. **Install the App**
2. **Open the App**
    - You will land on the onboarding page.
3. **Get Started**
    - Click on "Get Started."
    - Enter your name and birthday. If you don't enter a name, the default username will be "User," and the birthday will be set to the current day.
4. **Homepage**
    - After pressing "Register," you will be taken to the homepage of the app where you will see your username, current tasks, and an analysis of tasks (a pie chart of all tasks). Progress bars show the percentage of the year and month remaining.
    - There’s also a logout option on the top right. Clicking it will give you the option to clear account details, which will delete everything from tasks to notifications to the user account.
5. **Create Task**
    - At the bottom is the navbar. Click on "Create" to go to the create task page.
    - Here, write a brief description of your day. For example: "I wake up at 5:30 AM, do yoga for 30 minutes, have a smoothie at 6:00 AM, and start work at 6:30 AM. From 6:30 AM to 12:00 PM, I focus on client projects. After a quick lunch at 12:00 PM, I dedicate my afternoon to reading and research. At 3:00 PM, I take a short nap in my hammock, and at 4:00 PM, I work on my blog. Finally, at 7:00 PM, I have dinner and play the theremin for relaxation."
    - Select the date and click on "Generate."
    - After some time, tasks will be created, showing the title, description, and time for each task.
6. **Manage Tasks**
    - Click "Clear All" in the top left corner of the screen to delete all tasks and the text you wrote in the form.
    - Clicking "Done" will store the tasks locally on your device.
    - To view stored tasks, go to the "Tasks" section in the navbar, where all tasks will be displayed.
    - Your phone will display a notification for the current task.

**Note:** In the create page, after generating tasks, you can edit them (change the task description, title) and delete tasks you don’t like.

## Project Details

This project is a submission for the Google Gemini API Developer Competition. Despite our busy schedules, we created this app within a few months. We started planning at the end of May and began learning Flutter in the first week of June. Later, we started working on the actual app using Flutter.

We designed the UI using Figma, which is slightly different from the current app. You can view our design on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/design/ULZ6BLy6zvHRYHiFLYgAwZ/Gemini-Hackathon?node-id=0-1&t=PNkbIF9mOmRm7nqL-1).
